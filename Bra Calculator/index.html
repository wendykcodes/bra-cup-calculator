      <h2>POPULAR MYTHS</h2>
      <div class="myth-1">
        <h3>Myth 1: A bigger cup size means bigger breasts.</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily. Cup size is the volume of the breast relative to the bandsize, 
          so someone with a larger band may have a larger cup size even if their breast volume
          is similar to someone with a smaller band size.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="myth-2">
        <h3>Myth 2: If your cup size is "DD", it means you have really large breasts.</h3>
        <p>A "DD" cup can refer to a wide range of breast sizes depending on the band size paired with.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="myth-3">
        <h3>Myth 3: Your bra size stays the same throughout your life.</h3>
        <p>Your bra size can change due to various factors (e.g, weight changes, pregnancy, age), so
          it is important to check your measurements regularly.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="myth-4">
        <h3>Myth 4: You can't wear a smaller cup size if you're larger in the band.</h3>
        <p>
          Someone with a larger band size can still wear a smalleer cup size. The key is to find the right fit, 
          which involves both the band and the cup working together to provide comfort and support.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="myth-5">
        <h3>Myth 5: Bra cup sizes are the same across all brands.</h3>
        <p>
          Many brands use slightly different sizing systems, which is why trying on bras from different stores or brans may result in a different fit.
          Always prioritise comfort and fit over the number on the tag.
